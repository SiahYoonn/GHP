GHP Portfolio:
My name is Siah Yoon and I am a junior. I hope to deepen my understanding of machine learning and its real-world applications. Currently, I am working on several machine learning projects, but I heavily rely on documentation as Iâ€™m still in the learning phase. I believe that the summer program will help me take a step further and advance my knowledge and gain practical skills. I also hope to learn how machine learning can be applied to other fields of study, because its various applications always astonish me. Last year I did a presentation on AI in healthcare, so I am especially looking forward to the application of machine learning in biomedical engineering.
I have a passion for programming/machine learning and especially in applications involving UAVs or tennis.
I've tried out the YOLO models as well as tensorflow

videoloop.py is the UAV camera script
1. Stabilized video: easier for pilots to assume center
2. Successfully connects the Raspberry Pi to the UAV & runs as the pi boots up
3. Visualization of flight data

AUTO LANDING 2024 (Gazebo),py is the autonomous landing software for a UAV, applied on the gazebo simulation software
1. Utilization of ROS Melodic to simulate a virtual UAV + camera with all required parameters
2. Python Dronekit Library to control UAV from the Raspberry Pi
3. YOLOv8 model to detect targets & algorithm to center the UAV to it (data for training was collected by pilot)

AUTO LANDING 2024 (UAV),py is the autonomous landing software for a UAV, applied on an actual UAV
1. Identical to the gazebo simulation however ROS is not required and the code is attatched onto the camera script

Sign Language Recognition,ipynb is the ASL Translator using machine learning (ASL to English)
1. Mediapipe Holistic model to plot landmarks
2. Numpy arrays to label them & collected 30 videos w/ 30 sequences
3. Tensorflow Keras LSTM model to analyze the change in landmarks

just hand.py is the English to ASL portion in the ASL translator (I swear i had a file with all of the letters in the alphabet where did that go)
1. Pyserial library to connect python to the arduino
2. Adjustments of servo angles for mimicry
3. Slicing a string to express in order

In-progress works:
1. tennis shot detector
2. GUI to combine parts 1&2 of my ASL Translator
3. A more optimized autonomous landing software for latency on the raspberry pi 5
